# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript coding. The result is a webpage built with notes on each topic, all using each style of coding itself to make. This allows someone to study little facts on each subject, and hopefully commit them to memory. I learned the basics of each coding language, including building a webpage using HTML, styling it using CSS, making functions using JavaScript, and committing all changes to GitHub using Git.
